This snippet was created in response to a 4 hour software developer test. It comprised the following task: 
--------------------------------
Implement a library (in the programming language of your choice) which evaluates who are the winner(s) among several 5 card poker hands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands). Note for this project that you only need to implement a subset of the regular poker hands:
    . Flush
    . Three of a Kind
    . Two of a Kind
    . High Card

Input
Collection of players in the showdown: Player Name and 5 Cards (each specifying the number and suit of the card)
e.g., 
    . Joe, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 8H
    . Bob, 3C, 3D, 3S, 8C, 10D
    . Sally, AC, 10C, 5C, 2S, 2C

Output
Collection of winning players (more than one in case of a tie)
e.g.,
    . Joe

Please state any assumptions you've made.
--------------------------------

I chose Javascript for its felxibility and ease of use. I also decided to attempt to assign a value to each hand to represent its relative strength/score and avoid the need to sort and compare a set of hands. The winner of a game is the player with the highest score. 

The following assumptions were made: 
(0) there's always at least one winner
(1) the number of hands is a positive random integer
(2) the number of cards in a hand is a positive random integer less than 13
(3) the hands may have cards from more than one deck
(4) duplicate cards within a hand are ignored (from the score)
(5) each card is represented by 2-letter words, where the 1st letter identifies the rank (i.e., is in the set [1..10, J, Q, K, A]) and the 2nd letter identifies the suite (i.e., is in the set [D, H, C, S])
(6) the input contains the name of the player and the set of cards that form the player's hand where entities are comma-separated. 
(7) the player name does not contain spaces; if it does, they will not be present in the output (while the result will still be correct)
(8) the game is based on the standard poker rules as defined here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands 

The algorithm is quite simple indeed. 

The performance is decent: 
A single hand evaluation take ~1ms. 
10 hand evaluations take ~3ms.

Later, the following discussions were brought to my attention: 
    . Cactus Kev's Poker Hand Evaluator (http://www.suffecool.net/poker/evaluator.html)
    . Strategy Pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)


***

Since the completion of the task, I extended the computation to support a full set of standard poker hands in a 5+ card game. In practice, the number of cards in a hand does not really matter but it makes sense that it would not exceed 13. 

TODO: 
    . Document the algorithm
    . Add a short discussion / conclusion / improvements section
