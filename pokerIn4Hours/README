This snippet was created in response to a 4 hour software developer test. It comprised the following task:
-----------------------------------------------------
Implement a library (in the programming language of your choice) which evaluates who are the winner(s) among several 5 card poker hands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands). Note for this project that you only need to implement a subset of the regular poker hands:
    . Flush
    . Three of a Kind
    . Two of a Kind
    . High Card

Input
Collection of players in the showdown: Player Name and 5 Cards (each specifying the number and suit of the card)
e.g.,
    . Joe, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 8H
    . Bob, 3C, 3D, 3S, 8C, 10D
    . Sally, AC, 10C, 5C, 2S, 2C

Output
Collection of winning players (more than one in case of a tie)
e.g.,
    . Joe

Please state any assumptions you've made.
-----------------------------------------------------

Since the initial completion of the task, I extended the implementation to support a full set of standard poker hands.

Javascript was chosen for its flexibility and ease of use.

The following assumptions are made:
(0) there's always at least one winner
(1) the number of hands is a positive random integer
(2) the number of cards in a hand is a positive random integer less than 13; the number of cards in a hand does not really matter but it makes sense that it would not exceed 13.
(3) the hands may have cards from more than one deck
(4) duplicate cards within a hand are ignored (from the score)
(5) each card is represented by 2-letter words, where the 1st letter identifies the rank (i.e., is in the set [1..10, J, Q, K, A]) and the 2nd letter identifies the suite (i.e., is in the set [D, H, C, S])
(6) the input contains the name of the player and the set of cards that form the player's hand where entities are comma-separated.
(7) the player name does not contain spaces; if it does, they will not be present in the output (while the result will still be correct)
(8) the game is based on the standard poker rules as defined here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands

The algorithm is quite simple:
The objective is to assign a value to a hand of cards that reflects its strength/score according to the standard poker rules and avoid the need to sort and compare a set of hands. The winner of a game is the player with the highest score.

In order to compute the score, we view each hand as a two dimensional matrix. The sum across the columns gives us enough information to deduce whether we have four of a kind, three of a kind, two pair, or one pair. The sum across the rows gives us enough information to deduce whether we have  flush, straight, or straight flush. The last row also gives away the kickers.

For example, here is how 2H, 9D, 3S, 2C, QD looks like in such a matrix:
 +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
 |  | 0| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|13|14|  |
 +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
 | D|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1|  |  | 1|  |  | 0|
 | H|  |  | 1|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0|
 | C|  |  | 1|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0|
 | S|  |  |  | 1|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 0|
 +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
 |  |  |  | 2| 1|  |  |  |  |  | 1|  |  | 1|  |  | 0|
 +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
In this case, we have a pair with 3 kickers.

We compute from the left to the right which guarantees us that we always use the best available cards for the score and that the algorithm works just as well for 7-card hands, for instance.

This approach frees us from sorting cards and comparing hands. It uses fixed memory bound by the sparse 15 x 4 matrix. It runs in constant time needed to sum across the 13 used columns and the 4 rows.

The trick is in how to assign a score that is 'unique'. Consider the following formulas:

Hand Categories | Big Endian | Little Endian
----------------|------------+--------------------
Straight Flush  |          8 | kickers
Four Of A Kind  |          7 | k4
Full House      |          6 | p1 + k3*(10^2) 
Flush           |          5 | kickers
Straight        |          4 | kickers
Three Of A Kind |          3 | k3
Two Pair        |          2 | p2 + p1*(10^2)
One Pair        |          1 | p1
High Card       |          0 | kickers

where 
kickers = sum(ri*(10^(-15 + i))) where ri is the rank of the i-th card
k4 = hc*(10^-4) where hc is the highest rank that appears 4 times
k3 = hc*(10^-4) where hc is the highest rank that appears 3 times
p2 = hc*(10^-4) where hc is the second highest rank that appears 2 times
p1 = hc*(10^-4) where hc is the highest crank that appears 2 times

then the score = category * (category's big endian + category's little endian) + kickers.

The performance is decent:
A single hand evaluation takes ~1ms.
10 hand evaluations take ~3ms.

Later, the following discussions were brought to my attention:
    . Cactus Kev's Poker Hand Evaluator (http://www.suffecool.net/poker/evaluator.html)
    . Strategy Pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)

TODO:
    . Document the algorithm
    . Add a short discussion / conclusion / improvements section
    . Come up with a way to incorporate probabilities
