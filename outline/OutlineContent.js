Likewise, don't say, 'This is a three, this is a two, this is a one, this is a three,' etc. Do that and you'll almost always end up with a ton of really high-priority things. That's not really prioritizing.",

They're defining the rules of the game. And you can't beat someone who's making the rules. You need to redefine the rules, not just build something slightly better.",
	"If you're just going to be like everyone else, why are you even doing this? If you merely replicate competitors, there's no point to your existence. Even if you wind up losing, it's better to go down fighting for what you believe in instead of just imitating others."

["Hire managers of one", [
	"Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. They don't need heavy direction. They don't need daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do--set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc.--but they do it by themselves and for themselves."

["You don't create a culture", [	
	"You don't create a culture. It happens. This is why new companies don't have a culture. Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior. If you encourage people to share, then sharing will be built into your culture. If you reward trust, then trust will be built in. If you treat customers right, then treating customers right becomes your culture."

["Skip the rock stars", [

["Send people home at 5", [
	"As the saying goes, 'If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know.' You want busy people. People who have a life outside of work. People who care about more than one thing. You shouldn't expect the job to be someone's entire life--at least not if you want to keep them around for a long time."
