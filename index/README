This snippet is all about designing a web page. 

Initially I thought that it will be fast and easy. It is not. It is much easier to critique existing designs. My two roadblocks at the moment are presentation - use of colors and props - and content - what I really want to say. However, I laid out a css/html/js skeleton that would allow me to stay focused in my next attempt at the user interface. 

I wanted to see whether I can come up with a front page for the new product that the company I work for is preparing to launch. The product, in the area of (construction) business daily operations management) is not ready but a few sites were quoted as examples of the direction that we want to take with marketing it. Here are some of them: 
  metalab (http://www.metalabdesign.com/)
  pivotallabs (http://pivotallabs.com/)
  37signals (http://37signals.com/)

I thought that the metalab site is not cheerful and intuitive enough. Their color schema conveys a feeling of being down or sad. Their construction is somewhat banal without surprise or excitement. Depending on the screen size, their controls can be hard to manipulate.   

The pivotallabs site can be wordy as has been expressed at work and I agree.

The 37signals site is clean and functional. My hope was that we do not have to copy any of it but do better. As the 37signals team says (paraphrased) - for a project to grow, it should be fueled from within. 

Well, all these being said, after a day of work on it, I am nowhere near a catching, informative, easy to use, and engaging site. Work in progress...

Your feedback is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you, 
Ilka
